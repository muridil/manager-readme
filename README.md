## My Role

As Director of Engineering, my responsibility is to ensure that my engineering organization:

1. Delivers significant value to our customers.
2. Is a respected and integral part of the company, never working in isolation.
3. Builds software sustainably, which means:
    - Team members find their work fulfilling.
    - Quality continuously improves.
    - The software scales effectively as the company grows.
    - We leverage the capacity that we have in the most effective way.

I work through Engineering Managers who report to me, but I also value direct collaboration with everyone on the team.  
While Engineering Managers focus on the short term—typically sprints or even days—I focus on the longer term, spanning quarters or even years.

## North Star Principles

### People First

I love working with motivated—and especially self-motivated—people.  
Software development isn’t a linear process, and I truly believe that a motivated individual can create 10–50x more value than someone who’s just ticking off tasks.  
Collaboration is a multiplier, and we should optimize for it.

That’s why I tend to focus on creative solutions before reaching for more resources.  
The right people, given the right environment, can achieve extraordinary things.  
If you're not feeling that, tell me what needs to change so you can get there.

### Close to Tech

To make good decisions, I need to understand the area and the technology.  
What works best for me is starting with the big picture, then drilling down into a few very specific details.  
That combination gives me the confidence to connect the dots and make informed calls.

### It's All About Balance and Trade-Offs

In software engineering—just like in life—it’s all about constantly making choices.  
I believe time is the most important factor. There’s rarely a single "correct" option, because context matters and priorities shift.

I value people who can strike a thoughtful balance while being aware of the various options available.  
For example, technical design and framework selection is one of my favorite topics.  
There's often no single "best" choice, so spending too much time searching for one is usually a waste.

That’s why I prefer making decisions quickly, with the mindset that it's okay to fail fast—as long as it's in a controlled, intentional way.

### Effectiveness & Lean Approach

I always try to start with why—why we’re doing something in the first place.  
While I love elegant engineering solutions, they’re not always what’s needed right now—or yet.

I often come back to the idea of balance, making sure I’m not leaning too far toward over-engineering, or on the flip side, underestimating the importance of robustness and resiliency.

## Feedback & Disagreement

I believe feedback is critically important, and I actively seek it out.  
I’m a blunt person by nature—I value honesty and clarity over politeness when it comes to making things better.

At the same time, I respect that my scope of responsibility doesn’t extend to yours.  
Disagreement is healthy, as long as it's focused on improving the outcome.  
When someone disagrees, I expect them to follow up with a clear alternative proposal—it’s not just about saying “no,” but about helping us find a better “yes.”

## Setting Expectations

### Informed Captain, Single-Threaded Ownership

- A decision should have a clear owner: it’s either yours or mine, but not both. This ensures accountability and clarity.
- The captain (decision owner) is responsible for making an informed decision, relying on relevant data, expertise, and context.
- There are decisions that I need to make and others that you should make. I trust your ownership, and I won’t intervene in the decisions that are rightfully yours.

### Managers Don’t Have Monopoly on Leadership

- Leadership is expected from everyone, not only managers.

### Product and Engineering Are Two Equally Influential Forces

- The goal isn’t to keep everyone equally happy, but to find the right balance.

### Processes and Guidelines Are Here to Support Us

- SAFe, Scrum, Documentation, and other frameworks should never be followed just for the sake of it.
- If they don’t work, change them.

## Disclaimer

Manager's/Director's/VP's README has gained popularity so I decided to write one too.  
Bear in mind that this document should apply only to me, not anyone else, or the company.  
I wrote it to get to know me faster, level-set on expectations, and make our collaboration close and effective.  
The opinions and perspectives listed here are not set in stone. As I learn, my opinions can evolve too.
